<div style="width: 100%; padding: 0.3em; background-color: #F2F2F2; margin-top: 0.3em;">
The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models for stock market movements using two distinct regression approaches: Simple Regression and Bayesian Regression.

## Simple Regression
The goal of Simple Regression is to establish a linear relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable, providing a straightforward model for prediction. In this section our workflow involves collecting and exploring data, building and evaluating models, and ultimately interpreting the results to derive meaningful insights.

## Bayesian Regression
Bayesian Regression aims to account for uncertainty in predictions by incorporating prior knowledge and updating it with new data. We will follow theses steps:

1. **Prior Knowledge:**  - 2. **Data Update:**  - **Model Inference:** - **Uncertainty Quantification:** - **Interpretation:**

## Dataset
We are utilizing Apple stock price data obtained from Yahoo Finance, focusing specifically on the period from January 1, 2020, to December 1, 2023.
